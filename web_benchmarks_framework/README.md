# web_benchmarks_framework

A minimal framework to run performance tests for flutter apps in Chrome.
See [web_benchmarks_example](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-flutter-experimental/tree/develop/web_benchmarks_example) for an example.

This package is adapted from [macrobenchmarks](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/tree/master/dev/benchmarks/macrobenchmarks) and [devicelab](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/tree/master/dev/devicelab), the packages used by flutter to run performance tests in Chrome for the new Flutter Gallery.
